# About **Gustav Klimt**
<h2> Gustav Klimt (1862–1918) was an Austrian painter and one of the most prominent members of the Vienna Secession movement, which broke away from traditional academic art in favor of more modern, expressive styles. Born in Baumgarten, near Vienna, Klimt came from a modest background — his father was a gold engraver, which may have influenced Gustav's later love for gilded, decorative elements.

Klimt started his career painting murals and ceilings in public buildings but soon developed a more personal, avant-garde style. He became best known for his bold, sensual portraits of women, often adorned with elaborate patterns, gold leaf, and symbolic imagery. His most famous work, "The Kiss", exemplifies this luxurious and emotional aesthetic.

Themes of female beauty, eroticism, life, and death recur throughout his work, often challenging the conservative norms of the time. While celebrated, his art also faced criticism for its erotic nature.

Klimt died in 1918 at the age of 55 following a stroke and pneumonia, just as the Spanish flu pandemic was beginning. His legacy lives on through his influential role in modern art and his iconic contributions to the Art Nouveau movement. </h2>
